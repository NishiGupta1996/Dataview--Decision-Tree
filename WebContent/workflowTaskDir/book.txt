This is not an interesting book
because the more you read it the more you get
bored. Of course, writing a book is a huge undertaking.
I would rather write a manual for my DATAVIEW system.
Previously I have written two books, but they are not so popular.
Now, I am more interested in writing code, because you can immediately see
some results. I hope one day, DATAVIEW will become a popular programming environment
in which people will run parallel programs in the Cloud.
